  Cryogenesis, harnessing the power of cryo (ice), it shall freeze its opponents to their very core...
  
  A greatsword type prop weapon completely custom designed and 3D printed. The blade is made up of 3D prints printed from transparent PLA filament, layered internally with parchment paper, and an LED strip is attached underneath to give it a blue glow. There is also a 3ft long wooden pole in the middle to act as a support to ensure the prop doesn't fall apart (3D prints aren't that strong).

__Done! (04/25/2022)__

  Assembly finally complete. I added a wooden pole in the middle to act as a support for the 3D prints. I also layered the insides of the transparent blade with parchment paper to help diffuse the LED light better. Mosly held together with hot glue.

Overall, I'm not disappointed in the final product but I definitely think I can do better (especially with imperfections in the assembly due to too tight tolerances or hot glue not holding, etc) . But considering this is the first project I've taken on on this large of a scale, I'm still pretty happy with it.
